============

Make a summary figure illustrating global temperature changes since the dinosaurs went extinct.

This is dated now. I put it online in response to http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/03/can-we-make-better-graphs-of-global-temperature-history/ in case it helps someone make a better version.

The idea is to put predicted future changes in global temperature in the context of known past changes, and to communicate that comparison as clearly as possible.

Caveats:

1) This has not been peer-reviewed - use with caution.

2) I have scaled all the observational data to a common unit of 'global temperature anomaly w.r.t. 1961-90'. To do such a scaling properly would be very difficult and I did not try - I chose arbitrary scaling factors.
 This means this graph is not quantitatively robust and should not be treated as evidence of anything.
